<h1>Marketing Channels Analysis: Visitor Acquisition and Funnel Optimization </h1>
<br />
<h2>Description</h2>

<p><b>Objective:</b> To analyze visitor acquisition sources, identify key insights, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies and improve conversion performance.</p>

<p><b>Data Sources:</b></p>
<p>The analysis was conducted using the following datasets:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>projects_created.csv:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_ID</strong> â€“ each business after registration is assigned a unique identifier called PROJECT_ID.</li>
      <li><strong>VISITOR_ID</strong> â€“ a visitorâ€™s unique id; itâ€™s used to track visitors even before their signup.</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_REGISTRATION_DATETIME</strong> â€“ the time a project was created.</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_PLATFORM</strong> â€“ the platform the project was registered on (you can register a project directly on our website or, alternatively, use one of the platforms you create your websites on, e.g., WordPress or Shopify).</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_COUNTRY_ISO</strong> â€“ a two-letter geocode based on a websiteâ€™s location (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_INDUSTRY</strong> â€“ the industry code chosen by users during project registration.</li>
      <li><strong>SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE</strong> â€“ the date when the first subscription within a project was created.</li>
      <li><strong>FIRST_CONTRACT_VALUE</strong> â€“ the value of a subscription (in USD).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>homepage_visits.csv:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EVENT_DATETIME</strong> â€“ datetime the homepage was visited.</li>
      <li><strong>VISITOR_ID</strong> â€“ a visitorâ€™s unique id.</li>
      <li><strong>ACQUISITION_CHANNEL</strong> â€“ how the user entered our website and started the new session.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>costs.csv</strong> â€“ monthly cost (in USD) generated by each acquisition channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iâ€™ve additionally used Big Query Public data on iso country codes.</p>

<h3>Scope & Methodology</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data range</strong> â€“ October 2021</li>
  <li><strong>Methodology</strong> â€“ In the absence of a multiple attribution model, I chose to attribute conversion to the last channel customer interacted with prior to conversion. As conversion, I considered paid subscription.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Google BigQuery</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 1. How Does Traffic and Conversion Vary by Channel?</h3>

<p><b>The initial step</b> was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. I examined each of the .csv files to understand the columns they contained and how each of the tables is connected to each other. In other words, I needed to know which was the primary key, which was the foreign key, and how tables were connected via these keys so I could build a final logic.

<br />

<p>I started by analyzing the visits data to uncover key metrics: the total number of visits, unique visits, and the number of visits that led to registrations and paid subscriptions. I also calculated the conversion rates between each step to better understand the customer journey.</p>

```sql
-- Combined script to retrieve visits statistics and conversions
WITH visit_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve visit statistics
   SELECT
       COUNT(VISITOR_ID) AS total_visitors,
       COUNT(DISTINCT VISITOR_ID) AS unique_visitors
   FROM `portfolio.project.homepage_visits`
),
registration_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve data about visitors with registrations and paying customers
   SELECT
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.PROJECT_REGISTRATION_DATETIME IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS customers_with_registrations,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS paying_customers
   FROM
       `portfolio.project.homepage_visits` v
   JOIN
       `portfolio.project.projects_created` p
       ON v.VISITOR_ID = p.VISITOR_ID
)
SELECT
   vs.total_visitors,
   vs.unique_visitors,
   rs.customers_with_registrations,
   rs.paying_customers,
   --Calculate conversion rates
   ROUND(100 * rs.customers_with_registrations / vs.unique_visitors,1) AS conversion_to_registration,
   ROUND(100 * rs.paying_customers / rs.customers_with_registrations,1) AS conversion_to_payment
FROM
   visit_stats AS vs,
   registration_stats AS rs


```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p><b>Key Insight:</b> While the companyâ€™s home page is attracting a good number of visitors and repeat
visits, there is room for improvement in converting these visitors into registered users and paid subscribers.</p>
<h4>Additional Insights: </h4>
<p>A significant number of repeat visits suggest good engagement and retention. However, a notable drop-off occurs from unique visitors to registrations, with only 4.6%
converting. An even larger drop-off is observed from registrations to subscriptions, as only 4% of
those who register go on to subscribe.</p>
<p>
Identifying and addressing the reasons for these drop-offs can significantly improve
conversion rates. This may involve optimizing the registration and subscription processes,
offering more value or incentives to upgrade to paid plan, ensuring consistency in the
messaging and visuals between ads and the homepage, or enhancing the overall user
experience.

<i> <b> Disclaimer: </b> While analysing the data, it was noticed that some visitors have no recorded visits before their subscription date in October 2021, only after, making it impossible to attribute revenue to the last
acquisition channel before conversion. This might suggest possible visits in prior months or data tracking issues. Examples are available in the Appendix.</i>

<p><b>The next step</b> was to analyze the performance of each acquisition channel. This helped me identify which channels drive the most traffic and which ones excel or underperform in terms of converting users. 
  <br />
I simply tweaked the original script by adding the channel metric to gain these insights.

</p>

```sql
WITH visit_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve visit statistics by channel
   SELECT
       ACQUISITION_CHANNEL,
       COUNT(VISITOR_ID) AS total_visitors,
       COUNT(DISTINCT VISITOR_ID) AS unique_visitors
   FROM `portfolio.project.homepage_visits`
   GROUP BY ACQUISITION_CHANNEL
),
registration_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve data about visitors with registrations and paying customers by channel
   SELECT
       v.ACQUISITION_CHANNEL,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.PROJECT_REGISTRATION_DATETIME IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS customers_with_registrations,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS paying_customers
   FROM
       `portfolio.project.homepage_visits` v
   JOIN
       `portfolio.project.projects_created` p
       ON v.VISITOR_ID = p.VISITOR_ID
   GROUP BY v.ACQUISITION_CHANNEL
)
SELECT
   vs.ACQUISITION_CHANNEL,
   vs.total_visitors,
   vs.unique_visitors,
   rs.customers_with_registrations,
   rs.paying_customers,
   -- Calculate conversion rates by channel
   ROUND(100 * rs.customers_with_registrations / vs.unique_visitors, 1) AS conversion_to_registration,
   ROUND(100 * rs.paying_customers / rs.customers_with_registrations, 1) AS conversion_to_payment
FROM
   visit_stats AS vs
JOIN
   registration_stats AS rs
   ON vs.ACQUISITION_CHANNEL = rs.ACQUISITION_CHANNEL



```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p><b>Key Insight:</b> Almost all channels experience a low conversion rate to paid subscription, indicating that the strategy around encouraging users to upgrade to paid subscriptions may need to be refined.</p>
<h4>Additional Insights: </h4>
<p>Although <b>Channels 1 and 4</b> drive the most traffic to the homepage, they have the lowest
conversion rates to registrations. This may indicate issues such as overly broad targeting,
audience and/or message mismatch, or insufficiently compelling incentives to drive
registrations.</p>
<p>In contrast, <b>Channels 3, 5, 6, and 10</b> have the highest conversion rates to registrations,
with Channel 3 also excelling in paid subscriptions.
Analyzing Channel 3's success could provide valuable insights for other channels.</p>
<p><b>Channels 7 and 10 </b>face significant issues with paid subscriptions despite very high CR to
registrations, suggesting that users may not be seeing enough value during the trial
period or that the price of the paid subscription is perceived as too high.</p>
<p>Notably, there are no unique visitors from <b>Channel 9</b>, despite associated costs, which
could indicate the channel's ineffectiveness, tracking issues, or that it is simply an offline
channel not attributable to online traffic.

<i> <b> Disclaimer: </b> When analyzed by channels, the number of unique visits is 10.3% higher than the overall count, indicating that users are making multiple visits across different channels. It is advisable to implement multi-touch attribution modelling rather than attributing all the credit to either the first or last channel by default.</i>

<p><b>Another observation</b> I've made during my analysis was an <b>unusual traffic trend</b>. When I extracted the day of the week for each date in October, I noticed that, unlike most businesses that typically scale back marketing activities over the weekend, this companyâ€™s advertising team reduced efforts on Fridays and Saturdays. This led to a significant drop in traffic, followed by a sharp increase on Sundays. </p>
<p>  This pattern is unconventional, and unless the team is specifically targeting Arab countries (which further analysis does not support), it may be worth adjusting the strategy to align with more conventional marketing schedules for potentially better results.
</p>

```sql
select
 EXTRACT (day FROM EVENT_DATETIME) as visit_day,
 FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%A', event_datetime) AS day_of_week,
 COUNT(VISITOR_ID) as total_visitors,
 COUNT(DISTINCT VISITOR_ID) as unique_visitors
FROM `portfolio.project.homepage_visits`
GROUP BY visit_day,day_of_week
ORDER BY visit_day ASC
```

<h3>Question 2. How did different acquisition sources perform in attracting visitors in October 2021?</h3>
<p>After exploring the visits data, the next step was to evaluate the performance of the acquisition sources in terms of revenue, cost, and ROI.</p> 
<p>Given that visitors often come to the website multiple times and through various channels, I needed to determine how to attribute the revenue. Since the project focused on bottom-of-funnel activities, I chose to use a last-touch attribution model, giving credit to the last channel a visitor used before purchasing a paid subscription.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I created a script consisting of multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Filtering Paid Visitors:</strong> First, I filtered all visitors who had paid subscriptions, along with their first contract value.</li>
  <li><strong>Attribution Logic:</strong> Since I used the last-touch attribution model, I filtered visits that occurred only before the subscription date by comparing the EVENT_DATETIME with the SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE. During this step, I noticed some visitors had no recorded visits before their subscription date in October 2021, only after it. This made it impossible to attribute revenue to the last acquisition channel before conversion, which could suggest missing visits in prior months or data tracking issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying the Last Channel:</strong> The next step was to filter for the last channel before conversion, which I accomplished with two CTEs:
    <ul>
      <li>The first CTE assigned a row number to each visit for each user in descending order, using a window function so the visit just before the conversion would have a row number of 1.</li>
      <li>The second CTE filtered for channels with row number 1, indicating the last visit before conversion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calculating Costs and Revenue:</strong> The next two CTEs calculated the costs of each channel and the revenue. The revenue was calculated as the first contract value multiplied by 8, as the task description indicated that the lifespan of a project was equal to 8 months.</li>
  <li><strong>ROI and Additional Metrics:</strong> In the outer query, I calculated ROI and additional metrics such as revenue per customer and customer acquisition costs. These metrics ensure that your acquisition costs are justified by the revenue generated from new customers. For one channel with zero costs, I added a case statement to assign an extremely high ROI value to indicate infinite ROI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result was a table with 8 rows and 7 columns. I also noticed that I didnâ€™t have data for 3 out of 11 channels from the costs CSV file.</p>

<p>Finally, the output of the query was exported to Excel for follow-up analysis and visualizations.</p>

```sql
