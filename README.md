<h1>Marketing Channels Analysis: Visitor Acquisition and Funnel Optimization </h1>
<br />
<h2>Description</h2>

<p><b>Objective:</b> To analyze visitor acquisition sources, identify key insights, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies and improve conversion performance.</p>

<p><b>Data Sources:</b></p>
<p>The analysis was conducted using the following datasets:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>projects_created.csv:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_ID</strong> – each business after registration is assigned a unique identifier called PROJECT_ID.</li>
      <li><strong>VISITOR_ID</strong> – a visitor’s unique id; it’s used to track visitors even before their signup.</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_REGISTRATION_DATETIME</strong> – the time a project was created.</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_PLATFORM</strong> – the platform the project was registered on (you can register a project directly on our website or, alternatively, use one of the platforms you create your websites on, e.g., WordPress or Shopify).</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_COUNTRY_ISO</strong> – a two-letter geocode based on a website’s location (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).</li>
      <li><strong>PROJECT_INDUSTRY</strong> – the industry code chosen by users during project registration.</li>
      <li><strong>SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE</strong> – the date when the first subscription within a project was created.</li>
      <li><strong>FIRST_CONTRACT_VALUE</strong> – the value of a subscription (in USD).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>homepage_visits.csv:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EVENT_DATETIME</strong> – datetime the homepage was visited.</li>
      <li><strong>VISITOR_ID</strong> – a visitor’s unique id.</li>
      <li><strong>ACQUISITION_CHANNEL</strong> – how the user entered our website and started the new session.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>costs.csv</strong> – monthly cost (in USD) generated by each acquisition channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve additionally used Big Query Public data on iso country codes.</p>

<h3>Scope & Methodology</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data range</strong> – October 2021</li>
  <li><strong>Methodology</strong> – In the absence of a multiple attribution model, I chose to attribute conversion to the last channel customer interacted with prior to conversion. As conversion, I considered paid subscription.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Google BigQuery</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>
<h3>Question 1. How Does Traffic and Conversion Vary by Channel?</h3>

> <p><b>The initial step</b> was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. I examined each of the .csv files to understand the columns they contained and how each of the tables is connected to each other. In other words, I needed to know which was the primary key, which was the foreign key, and how tables were connected via these keys so I could build a final logic.

> <p>I started by analyzing the visits data to uncover key metrics: the total number of visits, unique visits, and the number of visits that led to registrations and paid subscriptions. I also calculated the conversion rates between each step to better understand the customer journey.</p>

```sql
-- Combined script to retrieve visits statistics and conversions
WITH visit_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve visit statistics
   SELECT
       COUNT(VISITOR_ID) AS total_visitors,
       COUNT(DISTINCT VISITOR_ID) AS unique_visitors
   FROM `portfolio.project.homepage_visits`
),
registration_stats AS (
   -- Retrieve data about visitors with registrations and paying customers
   SELECT
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.PROJECT_REGISTRATION_DATETIME IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS customers_with_registrations,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p.SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED_DATE IS NOT NULL THEN v.VISITOR_ID END) AS paying_customers
   FROM
       `portfolio.project.homepage_visits` v
   JOIN
       `portfolio.project.projects_created` p
       ON v.VISITOR_ID = p.VISITOR_ID
)
SELECT
   vs.total_visitors,
   vs.unique_visitors,
   rs.customers_with_registrations,
   rs.paying_customers,
   --Calculate conversion rates
   ROUND(100 * rs.customers_with_registrations / vs.unique_visitors,1) AS conversion_to_registration,
   ROUND(100 * rs.paying_customers / rs.customers_with_registrations,1) AS conversion_to_payment
FROM
   visit_stats AS vs,
   registration_stats AS rs
